Description: Computation and visualization of Bayesian Regions of Evidence
    to systematically evaluate the sensitivity of a superiority or
    non-inferiority claim against any prior assumption of its assessors.
    Methodological details are elaborated by Hoefler and Miller
    (<https://osf.io/jxnsv>).  Besides generic functions, the package also
    provides an intuitive 'Shiny' application, that can be run in local R
    environments.
